prune-backups.pl is intended to be run on a directory of backup files that have the date
embedded in the filenames, in the form yyyy.mm.dd. It implements a "grandfather, father,
son" stratefy for keeping files. It will delete files older than --years,
delete all except the 1st monthly file after --months, delete the daily files except 
the designated weekday after --weeks.


Requires perl-datetime, perl-getopt and perl-doc.

Simply copy this script to some place in your path, and run it against your
backup directory.

prune-backups.pl /var/backups/*

or run it in help mode for more details
